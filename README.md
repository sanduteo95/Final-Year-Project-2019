# Application of Futamura projections on a toy lambda calculus language

JavaScript interpreter implemented with the help of [Jison](https://github.com/zaach/jison) and [Lex](https://github.com/aaditmshah/lexer). 

Aims to become a compiler-compiler by applying the three [Futamura projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation) with the help of [Prepack](https://github.com/facebook/prepack).

## What it does
It ontains a lexer, parser, interpreter and a first application of the first Futamura projection on the interpreter. 
* The lexer tokenises and checks for incorrect syntax.
* The parser takes a string of code representing a program and produces an abstract syntax tree.
* The interpreter takes a string representing a lambda calculus program and runs through the parse tree generated by the parser to evaluate the value returned by the labda term.
* The first Futamura projection works based on the interpreter above

## Local development instructions
Run `npm run install` and then run the program following the instructions bellow:

`node index.js -V` - to return the version of the tool

`node index.js -h` - to return possible options for running the tool

`node index.js -p <pathToFile>` - to print out the parse tree for the provided file

`node index.js -i [-d] [-t] [-s number] <pathToFile>` - to return the result of interpreter on the provided file

`node index.js -f [-d] [-t] [-s number] <pathToFile>` - to return the result of applying the first Futamura projection on the provided file

Optional flags are:
* `-d`: to allow debugging log
* `-t`: to get execution time
* `-s number`: to set up the maximum number of consecutive recursive calls allowed

In case of `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` errors, add a `--stack-size=<value>` to the command. 
i.e. `node --stack-size=100000 index.js -i <pathToFile>`

The results can be tested out with various `-s` options passed through and analysed by looking in the `output` folder.

## How to run it
Install `futamura-js` by running `npm install -g futamura-js` and then type in `futamura-js --help` to see what options there are.
