# Application of Futamura projections on a toy lambda calculus language

JavaScript interpreter implemented with the help of [Jison](https://github.com/zaach/jison) and [Lex](https://github.com/aaditmshah/lexer). 

Aims to become a compiler-compiler by applying the three [Futamura projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation) with the help of [Prepack](https://github.com/facebook/prepack).

## What it does
It ontains a lexer, parser, interpreter and a first application of the first Futamura projection on the interpreter. 
* The lexer tokenises and checks for incorrect syntax.
* The parser takes a string of code representing a program and produces an abstract syntax tree.
* The interpreter takes two strings, one representing a program and one representing a function call, and runs through the parse tree generated by the parser to evaluate the value returned by the provided function call.
* The first Futamura projection works based on the interpreter above

## Local development instructions
Run `npm run install` and then run the program following the instructions bellow:

`node index.js -V` - to return the version of the tool

`node index.js -h` - to return possible options for running the tool

`node index.js -p <pathToFile>` - to print out the parse tree for the provided file

`node index.js -i <pathToFile>` - to return the result of interpreter on the provided file

`node index.js -f <pathToFile>` - to return the result of applying the first Futamura projection on the provided file

To run it against the toy lambda calculus language follow the instructions above. To run agains the toy JavaScript language, run the program with a `<language>` option set to `js`. (i.e. `node index.js -i <pathToFile> js`)

## How to run it
Install `futamura-js` by running `npm install -g futamura-js` and then type in `futamura-js --help` to see what options there are.
